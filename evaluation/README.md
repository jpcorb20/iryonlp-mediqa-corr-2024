# Evaluation from MEDIQA-CORR 2024

This is a local replica from the evaluation repo: [MEDIQA-CORR-2024](https://github.com/abachaa/MEDIQA-CORR-2024/blob/main/evaluation/mediqa-corr-2024-eval-script-2-all-metrics.py), but modified to be used as a CLI and to evaluate on a subset determined by the ids in the prediction file.
